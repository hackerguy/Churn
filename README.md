This Flask application utilizes IBM's Watson Machine Learning APIs to make predictions against a deployed machine learning
model created using Spark MLlib.

The model utilizes a Random Forrest classifier to predict whether a telco customer will churn based on a number of features
regarding the customer and their call usage.

An instance of the application running on IBM Bluemix can be accessed at https://churndemo.mybluemix.net/
